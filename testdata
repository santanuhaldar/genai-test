GDP (Inflation) Synthesis:
Gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted for inflation, increased at a 1.6 percent seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) in the first quarter of 2024, a deceleration from the 3.4 percent annualized growth rate in the prior quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). While real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) remained strong at a SAAR of around 2.25 percent and business fixed investment rose at a robust annualized growth rate, the headline GDP number was dragged down by the volatile net exports and inventory investment categories.[1]
Real final sales to private domestic purchasers, which is the sum of private consumption and investment and is sometimes referred to as core GDP, increased at a solid annualized rate. We also note that residential fixed investment surged at a annualized rate as commissions increased from stronger home sales figures and single-family construction remained robust.[2]

GDP (Inflation) Summarization:
Based on the search results, there are a few key points regarding the latest GDP projections: - GDP growth in the second half of 2014 is expected to be around 3.5% annualized, stronger than the first half of the year. This is driven by factors like stronger consumer spending, a better labor market, lower energy prices, and higher net worth.[1]
For 2015 and 2016, GDP growth is projected to be moderately above its potential rate, though slightly lower than previous forecasts. Positive factors like solid consumer spending and business investment are expected to be offset somewhat by weaker net exports due to a stronger dollar and subdued growth in trading partners.[3]
By 2017, most economic slack is expected to be dissipated, with GDP growth near its potential rate of around 1.8%.[4] 

Home prices (Synthesis):
median home prices in the United States are expected to increase by 1.8% in 2024 to a record of $396,800 (from $389,800 in 2023), and another 1.8% in 2025 to $403,800 (from 2024). NAR forecasts a modest 0.6% reduction in the median new home price to $426,100 in 2024 (from $428,600 in 2023), reflecting the building of smaller-sized homes. The association anticipates the median new home price will jump 3.4% to $440,500 in 2025 (from 2024).[1]

NAR expects home prices to rise roughly in line with consumer price inflation and wage growth over the next two years. Most homeowners are on strong financial footing, with only 2% of sales classified as being distressed. NAR expects home sales to steadily improve while home prices continue to hit record highs, driven by job gains, steady mortgage rates, and the release of inventory from pent-up home sellers.[3]

Home prices (summary)
home prices are expected to continue rising over the next 6 months, but at a slower pace compared to recent years. NAR predicts that the median existing home price will increase by 1.8% in 2024 to a record of $396,800, and another 1.8% in 2025 to $403,800.[1]
The slower price appreciation is attributed to home prices rising roughly in line with consumer price inflation and wage growth over the next two years. Additionally, NAR expects inventory to gradually rise from recent growth in home building, which should help moderate price increases. However, with job gains and steady mortgage rates, home sales are forecasted to improve steadily, supporting continued price growth.[2]
