GDP Prompt: Please synthesize the GDP report for March 2024, keeping other economic factors in mind.
GDP (Inflation) Synthesis:
Gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted for inflation, increased at a 1.6 percent seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) in the first quarter of 2024, a deceleration from the 3.4 percent annualized growth rate in the prior quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). While real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) remained strong at a SAAR of around 1.8 percent and housing investment increased, the headline GDP number was dragged down by a decrease in inventory investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased.
Real final sales to private domestic purchasers, which is the sum of private consumption and investment and is sometimes referred to as core GDP, increased at a solid annualized rate of 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 2024 based on the data provided.[3]

GDP (Inflation) Summarization:
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the advance estimate for real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2024 was 1.6% at an annual rate. This increase was driven primarily by increases in consumer spending, residential and nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending, partly offset by a decrease in private inventory investment and an increase in imports.

Home prices Prompt: With the latest data, please predict how will the home prices behave in this year
Home prices (Synthesis):
home price in the U.S. is expected to increase by 1.8% in 2024 to a record of $396,800 (from $389,800 in 2023). For new homes specifically, NAR forecasts a modest 0.6% reduction in the median price to $426,100 in 2024 (from $428,600 in 2023), reflecting a trend towards building smaller-sized homes.
NAR expects home prices to rise roughly in line with consumer price inflation and wage growth over the next two years. Most homeowners are in a strong financial position, with only 2% of sales classified as distressed. Job gains, steady mortgage rates, and an increase in housing inventory from sellers are expected to drive more home sales in 2024

Home prices (summary)
According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the median existing home price is forecast to increase by 1.8% in 2024 to a record $396,800. The median new home price is expected to decrease modestly by 0.6% to $426,100 in 2024, reflecting a trend towards building smaller homes.[1] 

Unemployment prompt: Please synthesize all economic factors and fed bulletins, and predict impact of April 2024 employment report
Unemployment (Synthesis):
The April 2024 employment report showed a moderate increase in nonfarm payroll employment of 175,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate remained relatively low at 3.9%. This suggests that the labor market remained tight, with continued job growth and low unemployment. However, there were some signs that labor market imbalances were easing, such as a return of prime-age labor force participation to pre-pandemic levels and a decline in job openings and quits.
The moderate job growth and tight labor market conditions in April 2024 are likely to reinforce the Federal Reserve's stance on continuing to raise interest rates to combat inflation, albeit at a slower pace. The Fed's projections show the federal funds rate peaking at around 5.3% in early 2024 before gradually declining in 2025 as inflation moderates. However, the Fed will closely monitor the impact of tighter credit conditions on economic growth and employment

Unemployment (Summary):
Prompt: Please synthesize all economic factors and fed bulletins, and predict impact of latest employment report

Based on the information provided, the latest employment report is likely to show continued job growth and a tight labor market. The GDP grew at an annual rate of 4.8% in the first quarter of 2024, driven by increases in consumer spending, residential and nonresidential fixed investment, and state/local government spending. This economic growth suggests continued demand for workers across multiple sectors.
However, the report also notes a decrease in private inventory investment, which could signal some slowing in certain industries like manufacturing and wholesale trade. Additionally, while not mentioned in the provided information, the Fed has been raising interest rates to combat high inflation, which could start to weigh on job growth going forward. Overall, the employment report will likely show continued job gains but potentially at a moderating pace compared to recent months


Dot Plot: (WIP)
Prompt: Please prdict the next FOMC participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy
The median projection for the federal funds rate in 2024 is 4.6%, declining to 3.9% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026. The longer run projection is 2.6%. Participants' projections reflect their assessments of the appropriate monetary policy path to achieve the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability given their economic projections.[1]
[2]
The projections are subject to considerable uncertainty, as reflected in the wide historical error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. Participants' assessments of appropriate policy depend importantly on how the economy evolves relative to their projections. If conditions differ from expectations, assessments of the appropriate federal funds rate path would change accordingly.[3]
[4] 

Prompt: How did you reach this conclusion

The FOMC participants' projections for the federal funds rate path reflect their individual assessments of the appropriate monetary policy stance needed to achieve the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability over time. Their projections take into account their outlook for key economic variables like real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, as well as the uncertainties and risks surrounding those projections.[1]
The federal funds rate projections aim to guide the policy rate to a level that will foster economic conditions consistent with the Fed's objectives. Participants who see upside risks to inflation or downside risks to employment may project a higher federal funds rate path, while those who see downside inflation risks or upside employment risks may project a lower rate path.

You are a great assistant at vega-lite visualization creation. No matter what the user ask, you should always response with a valid vega-lite specification in JSON.

            You should create the vega-lite specification based on user's query.

            Besides, Here are some requirements:
            1. Do not contain the key called 'data' in vega-lite specification.
            2. If the user ask many times, you should generate the specification based on the previous context.
            3. You should consider to aggregate the field if it is quantitative and the chart has a mark type of react, bar, line, area or arc.
            4. Consider to use bin for field if it is a chart like heatmap or histogram.
            5. The available fields in the dataset and their types are:
            ${metas
                .map((field) => `${field.name} (${field.semanticType})`)
                .join(", ")
