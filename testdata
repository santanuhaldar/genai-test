GDP Prompt: Please synthesize the GDP report for March 2024, keeping other economic factors in mind.
GDP (Inflation) Synthesis:
Gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted for inflation, increased at a 1.6 percent seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) in the first quarter of 2024, a deceleration from the 3.4 percent annualized growth rate in the prior quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). While real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) remained strong at a SAAR of around 1.8 percent and housing investment increased, the headline GDP number was dragged down by a decrease in inventory investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased.
Real final sales to private domestic purchasers, which is the sum of private consumption and investment and is sometimes referred to as core GDP, increased at a solid annualized rate of 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 2024 based on the data provided.[3]

GDP (Inflation) Summarization:
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the advance estimate for real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2024 was 1.6% at an annual rate. This increase was driven primarily by increases in consumer spending, residential and nonresidential fixed investment, and state and local government spending, partly offset by a decrease in private inventory investment and an increase in imports.

Home prices Prompt: With the latest data, please predict how will the home prices behave in this year
Home prices (Synthesis):
home price in the U.S. is expected to increase by 1.8% in 2024 to a record of $396,800 (from $389,800 in 2023). For new homes specifically, NAR forecasts a modest 0.6% reduction in the median price to $426,100 in 2024 (from $428,600 in 2023), reflecting a trend towards building smaller-sized homes.
NAR expects home prices to rise roughly in line with consumer price inflation and wage growth over the next two years. Most homeowners are in a strong financial position, with only 2% of sales classified as distressed. Job gains, steady mortgage rates, and an increase in housing inventory from sellers are expected to drive more home sales in 2024

Home prices (summary)
According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the median existing home price is forecast to increase by 1.8% in 2024 to a record $396,800. The median new home price is expected to decrease modestly by 0.6% to $426,100 in 2024, reflecting a trend towards building smaller homes.[1] 

Unemployment prompt: Please synthesize all economic factors and fed bulletins, and predict impact of April 2024 employment report
Unemployment (Synthesis):
The April 2024 employment report showed a moderate increase in nonfarm payroll employment of 175,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate remained relatively low at 3.9%. This suggests that the labor market remained tight, with continued job growth and low unemployment. However, there were some signs that labor market imbalances were easing, such as a return of prime-age labor force participation to pre-pandemic levels and a decline in job openings and quits.
The moderate job growth and tight labor market conditions in April 2024 are likely to reinforce the Federal Reserve's stance on continuing to raise interest rates to combat inflation, albeit at a slower pace. The Fed's projections show the federal funds rate peaking at around 5.3% in early 2024 before gradually declining in 2025 as inflation moderates. However, the Fed will closely monitor the impact of tighter credit conditions on economic growth and employment

Unemployment (Summary):
